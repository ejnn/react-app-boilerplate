# Pretty much just webpack configs.

Seized the opportunity to learn about webpack and
ended up with this repo (you'll probably want to use
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
 though).

If you see anything that doesn't look good,
I'd be glad if you point it out in an issue or something.
