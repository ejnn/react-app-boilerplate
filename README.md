# Description

Seized the opportunity to learn about webpack and
ended up with this repo (you'll probably want to use
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
 though).

# Usage

Just
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ejnn/react-app-boilerplate/initialize.sh && ./initialize.sh
```
while in your project's folder.
